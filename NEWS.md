# R62S3 1.4.0

## Minor Updates

* Minor updates to the whole package, backwards compatibility may be affected
* `mask` now applies to well-defined `S3` and `S4` methods only. This may affect backwards compatibility. Checking `S3` generics uses `utils::isS3stdGeneric` and checking `S4` generics uses `methods::.S4methods`, any other generic/method definitions are not recognised.
* Added support for *read-only* active bindings. A new `scope` argument allows the choice between generating public methods `"public"`, active bindings `"active"`, or both `c("public", "active")`. Support for all active bindings will be added in the future.
* Added support for excluding methods/bindings. A new `exclude` argument allows specific methods or bindings to be ignored by the generator.
* Added support to change the name of the dispatch object. The first argument in dispatch is used in the generic and method definition. The name of this argument can be changed by using the `arg1` argument.

* Backend abstracted into multiple helper functions
